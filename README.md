# studentRoster
A C++ Program that keeps track of a host of information about students in a class schedule

This application is built around parsing and manipulating data from an input string, and storing them in objects.  There are 2 classes in the project.

Student class
  Defines Student objects
  Stores variable data
  Functions that return data, as well as modify data

Roster class
  Parses data from a string
  Creates an array of pointers to Student objects
  Modifies data in the Student objects
  Ability to make calculations using Student object's data members and output results

The main function demonstrates the program's ability to use its functions, and outputs data in a legible format.
